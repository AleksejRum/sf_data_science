### Project description    
✔️ Creating the first model based on machine learning algorithms;
✔️ Taking part in the competition on Kaggle;
✔️ Understanding how to properly "prepare" the data so that your model works better.


### What case are we solving?  
Imagine that you work as a data scientist at a Booking company. One of the company's problems is dishonest hotels that wind up rating themselves. One of the ways to detect such hotels is to build a model that predicts the rating of the hotel. If the model's predictions are very different from the actual result, then perhaps the hotel is behaving dishonestly, and it is worth checking.

**What we practice**     
Сreate the first model using machine learning algorithms.
